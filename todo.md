### To Do

- Form validation to prevent blank todos being put in, and limiting word count
- Add edit function
    - User Clicks Edit button
    - This adds an edit form underneath that todo item, with the form value given as the todo, and with a submit button to allow user to submit their edited todo
    - Button click sends edit to server. makes changes. if successful, success object sent back to client. if not, then error object
    - If Success, then hide 'edit' section
- Add success/error messages
- Make it look nice
